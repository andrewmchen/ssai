SSAI (Whatever you want the acronym to mean)
=========================================
An AI for Super Smash Bros Melee. Joint project with [Richard Liaw](https://github.com/richardliaw). Right now it's not much of an AI. All it does is spit out pixel dumps with matplotlib from a hacked fork of [Dolphin](https://github.com/andrewmchen/dolphin/tree/first). 

Usage
-----
```bash
$ python -m ssai
```

It's a bit of a pain to exit from.. In my workflow I use
```bash
$ <CTRL-Z>
$ kill %1
```

Pictures
